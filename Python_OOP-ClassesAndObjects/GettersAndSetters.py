"""The following example shows a class, which has internal attributes, which
 can't be accessed from outside. These are the private attributes
 self.__potential _physical and self.__potential_psychic. Furthermore we show
 that a property can be deduced from the values of more than one attribute.
 The property "condition" of our example returns the condition of the robot in
 a descriptive string. The condition depends on the sum of the values of the
 psychic and the physical conditions of the robot.
