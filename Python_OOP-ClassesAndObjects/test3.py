"""
Our next task is rewriting our Robot class. Though we have Getter and Setter
 methods for the name and the build_year, we can access the attributes direct-
ly as well, because we have defined them as public attributes. Data Encapsula-
tion means, that we should only be able to access private attributes via gett-
ers and setters.

We have to replace each occurrence of self.name and self.build_year by
 self.__name and self.__build_year.
